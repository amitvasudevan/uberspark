Software Requirements and Dependencies
======================================

The |uspark| toolkit relies extensively on ``docker`` with the goal of supporting a wide variety of CoSS 
development environments and architectures (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Windows WSL. etc.). The toolkit
therefore has just two requirements to get started: ``docker`` and a ``make`` utility capable of reading
Makefiles (e.g., GNU Make).
