Introduction
============

The |uberspark| |cosslong| (|coss|) Developer's Guide describes the various framework elements and 
development and verification work-flow and aims to enable seamless integration into an existing 
|coss| source-code base. 

This guide is intended for |coss| stack developers who are interested in refactoring their existing
legacy code-base to take advantage of |uberspark|'s capabilities.
