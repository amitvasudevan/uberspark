Introduction
============

The |uberspark| Contributor's Guide describes the various framework and tool-chain internals
and work-flow that aims to enable seasoned developers to contribute changes to and extend the
core framework. 

This guide is intended for developers who are interested in contributing features or enhancements
to the core |uberspark| framework including but not limited to: the documentation, front-end CLI, sentinels, 
hardware models, loaders, bridges, |uobj| runtime libraries, and the core |uberspark| tool modules. 

.. note::   Ocaml imperative programming is a pre-requisite for developers wishing to contribute to the
            |uberspark| tool modules and front-end CLI. All other components require the knowledge 
            of C and Assembly programming, including knowledge of the underlying hardware (in case of 
            hardware models).
