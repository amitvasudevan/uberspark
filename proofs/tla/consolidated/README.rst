Introduction
------------

This folder holds the consolidated TLA+ model for the uobject execution ecosystem.


Notes
-----

1. MMU modeling will help us with memory integrity and control-flow integrity 
invariants

2. Once we model MMU, IOMMU/DMA controller
 is going to be similar to model on the device side
